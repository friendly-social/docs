# Idea

> This text is written by @y9san9, and I am the one who came up with the initial idea. However, I do not claim any rights on the idea. My dream is to be able to work on something that is useful for people and developed in a distributed way like Linux or Neovim is.

We see a growing problem in the society as a whole. People are meant to be closer with all this global things existing like Instragram, Facebook, Twitter, etc. But in reality it leads to people trying to increase their popularity metrics which makes everything look fake. The best example of this is LinkedIn which is basically an AI-Driven slop where people go clap-maxxing.

We need to solve that. And we believe that it can be done with so called 'Intranets'. When instead of a single global Internet, you have lots of locally closed Intranet. Ideally, each person should have their own Intranet. With the ability to add and remove people from it.

## Meeting new Friends

Phase 1 of the project tries to solve the first part of the problem. Instead of meeting complete strangers, you need to work with the network you already have. We build something similar to a dating app, but the goal is to meet people that are already around you. When you register, you will be prompted to scan a QR of existing user and then you will have their friends in your Feed. If you add more friends, we will show you what are some common friends with a person that you see now.

This idea solely covers many use-cases for people:

- **Expand your network in the direction you want**
    - Board games? Programming? Surely friends of your friends also like that, you can navigate your network in any direction you want
- **Find friends in new niches**
    - Want to do Design? You just add a single designer and now you have a whole new community talk to
- **Random Coffee**
    - This is a native solution to meet new people at your workplace, university, school, anywhere locally
- **Dating is actually better when you have common friends**
    - Less time spent on random people
    - No creeps that don't care about what you think about them

This phase is what we internally call 'MVP'.

## Posts

After some time and after you met some people, you have nothing to do in the app anymore. But there is a room for a very coherent feature. Why don't we add an ability to talk with people you added? There's no other place for that.

**Twitter** is public. You don't have the vibe and locality. Private **Instragram** profiles do not give you a good way to meet new people and it's mainly photo-based which leads to _the fakiness_ that was discussed before.

We are going to introduce a private space, so called Intranet, for people inside of it. It is going to be a very similar format to what **Twitter**, **Mastodon**, **Bluesky** and many others do. With the exception that there will be no public space. Only people that you added will be able to see your posts.

You can meet someone new in the comments under posts of your friends as well. If you like someone - add them to your network and chat with them.

There will be no single-side following. The only way to follow someone posts is if they follow you back as well. Many numbers are private like overall amount of friends and others that show persons popularity. Communication in the app is **always mutual**.

The locality also leads to natural absense of spam and non-honest advertisement.

## Multiverse

The coherent next feature is add an ability to create multiple locale spaces for relatives, friends, some interest group (like people from university), etc. This is also on board. We plan to support multiverses like Servers on **Discord**, but where anyone can create multiple personal Servers. The cool part is that banning someone from the server does not cut off others people communication with that guy.

## The End?

Maybe. But we want to keep things clean and coherent. No mega-apps. That makes money to businesses, but we plan to live off of your donations. So the hapiness of the user is the only metric we care about. If we will want to add something to the idea of Intranet apps we will build a new app and use Friendly as **oauth** server.

We believe that not every app should get more and more features. At some point you have to say "We are done". But it's a long journey before that.
