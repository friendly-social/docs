# Laboratories

The development process of Friendly is unique in a sense. Everyone who works on that project has main job and therefore can't work on that project full-time. Sometimes only a few hours a week are available for a side project and that's fine. We still want to collaborate on that thing with everyone interested. For that matter a concept of 'Labs' was created.

What is a Lab? Lab is an independent research group (or a single person) that is scoped to a single research area or a project. All Labs are created equal meaning that no Lab is more important and there is no hierarchy. If someone doesn't like what a Lab is doing, they can create a new one on the same topic. A Lab can be abandoned at any point of time.

This concept helps us to maintain a consistent pace where project is always growing in several domains. We accumulate Individual Contributors and don't need to have managers and stuff. Failure of a single Lab doesn't affect other Labs. Everyone is free to try creating a new Lab with no real responsibilities since it can be abandoned at any time.
