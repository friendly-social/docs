# 2025.4: MVP Preparation

The project started as an idea in 2025 and in the first quarter of the project we couldn't prepare the first release. Things we implemented:

- [x] Backend in Kotlin
- [x] SDK in Kotlin
- [x] SDK in Go
- [x] Android App
- [x] iOS App

Kotlin backend is closed-source. However, whoever wants to join us will be able to see the sources. It's not that we hide something, but rather we didn't go through any audit process yet. We want to iterate fast, so some hacks are also in place. And we will definitely open-source backend later on.

And some things that we didn't do yet and plan to do in the next season before the MVP Release:

- [ ] Web App
- [ ] Go CLI App
- [ ] Android App Polishing
- [ ] iOS App Polishing

The main blocker for the MVP release being held in this season is Web App. We finished everything else basically and could cut some angles and do the MVP release, but Web App is barely started and we can't release without the Web App.

That's why I ([@y9san9](https://github.com/y9san9)) am going to take his 4th project (after Backend, SDK and iOS) and will lead Web Lab as well. So the next season should be a proper MVP release.
