# Api

This folder contains documentation for API requests. Not all of them, older ones
are not documented, but implemented in
[Kotlin SDK](https://github.com/friendly-social/kotlin-sdk) or
[Golang SDK](https://github.com/friendly-social/golang-sdk). I will also provide
documentation for specific endpoints on demand – just contact me. I am not doing
all work in advance, but if someone needs info about something specific, I will
add new files covering these questions.

PRs are very welcome on filling that gap!

Changelog can be found here: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

> [!NOTE]
> **I don't use swagger.**
> I really don't have much joy when I write swagger. And
> autogenerated ones are always some kind of hack. This is a pet project, so
> swagger would really demotivate me continue implementing new endpoints. Might
> be a skill issue and it easily might be that I just didn't learn it. I will
> use markdown and cURL-formatted http requests.
