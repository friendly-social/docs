# Friendly

They say you are connected to anyone with 5 degrees of separation. But what about all those people that are just 2 degrees away from you? Often friends of your friends are fantastic and interesting people we don't really have much chance to know. That is what Friendly is for. No global search. No creeps. Expand your network!

## Development and Labs

The development process of Friendly is unique in a sense. Everyone who works on that project has main job and therefore can't work on that project full-time. Sometimes only a few hours a week are available for a side project and that's fine. We still want to collaborate on that thing with everyone interested. For that matter a concept of 'Labs' was created.

What is a Lab? Lab is an independent research group (or a single person) that is scoped to a single research area or a project. All Labs are created equal meaning that no Lab is more important and there is no hierarchy. If someone doesn't like what a Lab is doing, they can create a new one on the same topic. A Lab can be abandoned at any point of time.

This concept helps us to maintain a consistent pace where project is always growing in several domains. We accumulate Individual Contributors and don't need to have managers and stuff. Failure of a single Lab doesn't affect other Labs. Everyone is free to try creating a new Lab with no real responsibilities since it can be abandoned at any time.
